# Pre Authorized Debit
CED Level1 Capstone Project - Solidity Smart Contract

Pre-authorized debits (PADs) are an extremely convenient way to pay bills and make other payments automatically. Instead of a consumer sending payments to a provider of services, a company withdraws funds from the consumer’s bank account. It's a useful way to pay bills like mortgage, utilities, donations and insurance premiums. The consumer, aka the payor, has to provide permission to the service provider, aka the payee, to withdraw funds from the payor’s bank account. The benefit to the payor is that bill payments are performed automatically, avoiding missed payments, and amounts deducted can be variable as determined by the payee company based on consumed services, e.g. monthly utility bills can vary.

However, the current process is lengthy, error prone, involves a paper trail and does not provide much control to the payor whose funds are being removed.

Pre Authorized Debit (PAD) is a Solidity smart contract made to overcome the limitations and burdens associated with setting up a PAD agreement for variable payments. The primary goal is to return control of PAD set up and maintenance back to the payor, the owner of funds. The blockchain capability for smart contract execution also allows for increased turnaround for PAD agreements, a matter of minutes or hours instead of weeks as happens currently.
